operation
    1. read config
    2. get ifi info
        for every ip
        create a socket and bind
        (we don't bind broadcast, // did we do?
        only unicast and loopback

        build an array for each socket with
            sockfd
            ip addr bound
            net mask
            subnet
        (report in a readme // TODO
        (!!!! ensure only unicast bound // TODO
        print essential messages
    3. use select to wait for incoming
    4. use recvfrom to get the datagram and get the client addr (ip and port)
    5. fork a child and parent go back to loop to use select for listening
    6. check client local or not, print out results
    7. child process create a new socket to handle file transfer, connection socket
        bind to server ip and wildcard port
        get sock name to get ip and port num, print out
        connect conn sock to client ip and port
    8. server child process send a datagram using listening socket(inherited from parent)
        to ack client with the conn sock port (should be backed up by ARQ 
            and retransmitted in the event of loss) // 2nd, ACK + SYN
        (if this dgram lost, client may retransmit the dgram which carries the filename
         !!! we must ensure the retransmitted request for a new client
         // TODO
         'race' condition?)
    9. server conn sock should receive an ACK from client // 3rd ACK
        close the listening socket
        (if server times out, meaning didn't receive the 3rd ACK
         !!! server child should retransmit the dgram with conn sock port # twice
         both by listening and connection sock, for that didn't know client sock is
         connected to which port) // TODO
    10. transmit data via conn sock
