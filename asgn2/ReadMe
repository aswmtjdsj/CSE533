the structure for storing the information of each socket
--->in utils.h
struct sock_info_aux {
    int sock_fd;
    struct sockaddr * ip_addr;
    struct sockaddr * net_mask;
    struct sockaddr * subn_addr;
};

3.
RTT mechanism
--->in utils.h and utils.c and server.c

struct rtt_info {
    int rtt_rtt; /* most recent measured RTT, in milliseconds */
    int rtt_srtt; /* smoothed RTT estimator, in milliseconds */
    int rtt_rttvar; /* smoothed mean deviation, in milliseconds */ 
    int rtt_rto; /* current RTO to use, in milliseconds */
    int rtt_nrexmt; /* # times retransmitted: 0, 1, 2, ... */
    uint32_t rtt_base; /* # msec since 1/1/1970 at start */
};

modification: change all numeric operation from float to int

keypoint:
a. every datagram during file transmission, has its own rtt_info structure
    which means each datagram has its own timeout timer
b. after receiving each valid ACK from client, server will update RTO of several datagrams,
    which are in the sender sliding window, sent but not acked.
